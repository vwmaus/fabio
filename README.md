# FABIO
Food and Agriculture Biomass Input-Output Tables

In 2015 we started building physical supply-use and input-output tables covering global agriculture and food production, aquaculture and forestry. The work is fully based on freely available data from FAOSTAT, IEA, EIA and UN Comtrade.

FABIO now covers 191 countries, 116 processes and 130 commodities for the years 1986-2013. This code is distributed under the GNU General Public License Version 3. An R package is in preparation.
